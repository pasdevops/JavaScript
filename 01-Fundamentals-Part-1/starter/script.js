// All JavaScript need to linked to HTML

/*
let js = "amazing";
console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10);

console.log("Jonas");
console.log(23);

let firstName = "Matilda";

console.log(firstName);
console.log(firstName);
console.log(firstName);

let country = "Indonesia";
let continent = "Asia";
let population = "500000"

console.log(country);
console.log(continent);
console.log(population);

 In line script means you dont need to create a separate file

Carmel Case is the used for variable in JS naming convention

/*There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. They are:

Data Types	Description	Example

String	represents textual data	'hello', "hello world!" etc

Number	an integer or a floating-point number	3, 3.234, 3e-2 etc.

BigInt	an integer with arbitrary precision	900719925124740999n , 1n etc.

Boolean	Any of two values: true or false	true and false

undefined	a data type whose variable is not initialized	let a;

null	denotes a null value	let a = null;

Symbol	data type whose instances are unique and immutable	let value = Symbol('hello');

Object	key-value pairs of collection of data	let student = { };

Here, all data types except Object are primitive data types, whereas Object is non-primitive.
*/

/*Dynamic typing

let javascriptIsFun = true;
console.log(javascriptIsFun);

console.log(typeof true);
console.log(typeof javascriptIsFun);
console.log(typeof 23);
console.log(typeof "Jonas");

javascriptIsFun = "YES";
console.log(typeof javascriptIsFun);

When you define empty variable the values will be undefined and the typeof will undefined

Undefined is both the value and the type

let year;
console.log(year);
console.log(typeof year);

This is a viable 
year = 1991;
console.log(typeof year);

console.log(typeof null);
